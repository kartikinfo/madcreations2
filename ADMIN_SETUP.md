# 🔐 Admin Authentication Setup

## Admin User Created Successfully!

A Firebase admin user has been created with the following credentials:

### 🔑 Admin Login Credentials

```
Email: admin@madcreations.com
Password: MadCreations@2024
```

## 🚀 How to Access Admin Panel

### Option 1: Direct Admin Login Page
Visit: `http://localhost:3000/admin-login`
- Dedicated admin login page with credentials displayed
- Secure authentication flow
- Redirects to admin dashboard upon successful login

### Option 2: Regular Login + Admin Access
1. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/admin`

## 🛡️ Admin Security Features

### Multi-Layer Admin Verification
The system checks admin status through:
1. **Email Whitelist**: `admin@madcreations.com`, `kartikbaskaran2@gmail.com`
2. **Firestore Admin Collection**: Dedicated `admins` collection
3. **User Profile Role**: `isAdmin: true` flag in user profile

### Admin Permissions
- Full access to admin dashboard
- Product management (CRUD operations)
- Order management and tracking
- Customer management
- Analytics and reports

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Firebase Collections Created
1. **users/{uid}** - Admin user profile with `isAdmin: true`
2. **admins/{uid}** - Dedicated admin record with permissions

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in with Firebase Auth
2. `AuthContext` checks admin status via `checkAdminStatus()`
3. Multiple verification methods ensure security
4. `isAdmin` state controls access to admin routes

## 🎯 Admin Routes

- `/admin` - Main admin dashboard
- `/admin/products` - Product management
- `/admin/orders` - Order management  
- `/admin/customers` - Customer management
- `/admin/analytics` - Analytics (placeholder)
- `/admin/settings` - Settings (placeholder)

## 🔄 Creating Additional Admins

To create more admin users, run:
```bash
npm run create-admin
```

Or manually add emails to the whitelist in `AuthContext.tsx`:
```typescript
const adminEmails = ['admin@madcreations.com', 'your-email@domain.com'];
```

## 🚨 Security Notes

1. **Change Default Password**: Update the admin password after first login
2. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive config in environment variables
3. **Firebase Rules**: Ensure proper Firestore security rules
4. **HTTPS Only**: Use HTTPS in production
5. **Regular Audits**: Monitor admin access logs
